# Setup

First, we load the tidyverse package.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then, we need to install the package `nycflights13`. The package contains the following five datasets: _airlines_, _airports_, _planes_, _weather_, and _flights_. For explanations on the data use `help(airlines)`, `help(airports)`, etc. To make the data visible in the global environment we need to assign them to some variable.

```{r}
airlines <- nycflights13::airlines 
airports <- nycflights13::airports
planes <- nycflights13::planes
weather <- nycflights13::weather
flights <- nycflights13::flights
```

# Analyse data
## Airlines
- Inspect the airlines data and print the first 5 rows.

```{r}
dim(airlines)
str(airlines)
head(airlines, 5)
```


## Airports 
- Inspect the airports data and print the first rows. 
- The variabe `alt` represents the airport's altitude in feet. Replace `alt` by the corresponding altitude in meters (meter = feet / 3.28084). Then filter for the 5 airports with the highest altitude
- Filter for all airports which are located at an altitude lower than sea level
```{r}
dim(airports)
str(airports)
head(airports)
airports <- airports %>%
  mutate(alt = alt / 3.28084)
airports%>%
  arrange(desc(alt))%>%
  head(5)
airports%>%
  filter(alt<0)
```



## Weather
- Inspect the data and print the first rows. 
- Does the data only cover New York or also the weather at destination airports? 
- Change the units to European standards:  
  * Temperature (`temp`) and dew point (`dewp`): Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9 
  * Visibility (`visib`): kilometer = miles * 1.60934
  * Wind speed (`wind_speed`): kilometer/hour = (miles/hour) * 1.60934
  * Precipitation (`precip`): millimeter = inches * 20.54
- What was the 2013 average of `temp`, `wind_speed`, and `visib` at the JFK airport?
- What was the *monthly* average of `temp`, `wind_speed`, and `visib` at the JFK airport?
- What was the minimum `temp`, the maximum `temp`, and the total amount of `precip` at each of the 3 airports in December 2013? 

```{r}
dim(weather)
str(weather)
summary(weather)
weather%>%distinct(origin)
head(weather)
weather <- weather%>%
  mutate(dewp = (dewp - 32)*5/9, temp = (temp - 32)*5/9)
weather <-weather%>%
  mutate(visib = visib * 1.60934, wind_speed = wind_speed * 1.60934)
weather <-weather%>%
  mutate(precip = precip*20.54)

shortname <- as.character(airports[grep("Kennedy", airports$name), 1])  #unnötige Spielerei...das Kürzel "JFK" ist nicht kompliziert zu finden
weather%>%
  select(origin, year, temp, wind_speed, visib)%>%
  filter(origin == shortname, year == 2013)%>%                          #unnötig 2013 anzugeben...Datensatz enthält nur 2013er Daten
  summarise("Avg Temp in °C" = mean(temp), "Avg Wind Speed in km/h" = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE), "Avg Vibility in km" = mean(visib))

airports%>%
select(Airport = name, Shortname = faa)%>%
right_join(weather%>%
  group_by(Shortname = origin)%>%
  filter(year == 2013, month==12)%>%
  summarise("Min Temp"=min(temp), "Max Temp"=max(temp), "Total Precip"=sum(precip)),  by = "Shortname")



```


## Planes
- Inspect the planes data and print the first 5 rows.
- Count the numer of planes per `manufacturer` and sort in descending order? 
- Calculate per manufacturer: 1. number of planes, 2. average number of `seats`, 3. average number of `engines`, 4. average `year` when the planes where manufactured. And again order in descending order of the number of planes

```{r}
dim(planes)
str(planes)
summary(planes)
head(planes, 5)

planes$manufacturer<-planes$manufacturer%>%
  str_replace_all("AIRBUS INDUSTRIE", "AIRBUS")%>%
  str_replace_all("MCDONNELL DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT CO", "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS")%>%
  str_replace_all("MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION", "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS")

planes%>%
  group_by(manufacturer)%>%
  summarise(models = n_distinct(tailnum))%>%
  arrange(desc(models))

planes%>%
  group_by(manufacturer)%>%
  summarise("No. of planes"=n_distinct(tailnum), "Avg No. of seats"=mean(seats), "Avg. No. of engines"=mean(engines), "Avg. year of manufacture"=as.integer(mean(year, na.rm = TRUE)))%>%
  arrange(desc(`No. of planes`))

```


## Flights
- Inspect the flights data and print the first 5 rows.
- Count the total number of flights and the average delay during the whole year per `hour` of departure.
- Count the number of flights by destionation airport (`dest`) and arrange them in descending order.

```{r}
str(flights)
summary(flights)
flights[1:5, ]

flights%>%
  group_by(hour)%>%
  summarise("No. of flights"=n_distinct(flight), "Avg. delay of arrival"=mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

airports%>%
  select(Airport = name, Shortname = faa)%>%
  right_join(
    flights%>%
      group_by(Shortname=dest)%>%
      summarise("No. of distinct flights"=n_distinct(flight))%>%
      arrange(desc(`No. of distinct flights`)),
  by = "Shortname")
```


# Join datasets 
Join the five data sets into one large data set. To better understand the relationship between them, study the file _img/table_realtionships.PNG_ (or alternatively knit this Rmd file.) 

![](img/table_relationships.PNG){width=70%}

```{r}
# Joining arrival-airports (arr.) and destination-airports (dest.) with flights and adding to df
df <- airports %>%
  rename_all(function(x){paste0("origin.", x)})%>%
  right_join(flights, by=c("origin.faa"="origin"))%>%
  left_join(airports %>%
      rename_all(function(x){paste0("dest.", x)}), by = c("dest"="dest.faa"))%>%
  rename("origin"="origin.faa")
  
# Adding planes to df
df<-df %>% 
  left_join(planes%>%rename("manufactured"="year"), by="tailnum")

#Adding airlines to df
df<-df%>%
  left_join(airlines%>%rename("airline"="name"), by="carrier")

#Adding weather of origin Airport to df
df<-df%>%mutate(origin.hour = as.integer(dep_time/100))%>%
  left_join(weather%>%rename_all(function(x){paste0("weather.", x)}), by = c("origin" = "weather.origin", "year"="weather.year", "month"="weather.month", "day"="weather.day", "origin.hour"="weather.hour"))

#Adding weather of destination Airport to df - useless action, because there is no data available
#df<-df%>%mutate(dest.hour = as.integer(arr_time/100))%>%
#  left_join(weather%>%rename_all(function(x){paste0("weather.dest.", x)}), by = c("dest" = "weather.dest.origin", "year"="weather.dest.year", #"month"="weather.dest.month", "day"="weather.dest.day", "dest.hour"="weather.dest.hour"))
```

# Freely explore
Some questions for inspiration:

- Do smaller planes (as measured by the number of seats) have less departure delay?
- What is the average flight distance and the average delay by airline
- What's the average delay by airline? (But note that this will be strongly correlated with flight distance, 
- Is bad weather (precipitation, low visibility, low temperatures) related to departure delay?
